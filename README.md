The program for STM32F103C6T6 was initialized by the STM32CubeMX tool and written in C in the Keil uVision5 environment. The algorithm and software have been developed to read pressure from the sensor and control the BLDC motor, as well as to maintain the set pressure. The algorithms for controlling the engine speed and maintaining the set pressure are based on a PID controller with feedback from sensors.
